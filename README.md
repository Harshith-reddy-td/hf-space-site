# üéµ Text2Audio - GitHub Pages Site

This GitHub Pages site maps and embeds the **IFMedTechdemo/Text2Audio** Hugging Face Space, bringing powerful text-to-audio generation directly to visitors through a clean, accessible interface.

## üéØ What This Site Does

This project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate a Hugging Face Space into a GitHub Pages site. The embedded Text2Audio Space allows users to:

- Convert text descriptions into audio
- Experience AI-powered audio generation
- Access the full Space functionality without leaving the page

## üöÄ For Visitors

Simply visit the [live site](https://harshith-reddy-td.github.io/hf-space-site/) to start using the Text2Audio generator. No additional setup needed!

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers & Contributors

### How It Works

The site uses an embedded iframe to display the IFMedTechdemo/Text2Audio Hugging Face Space. The `index.html` file contains the embedding code that loads the Space interface directly on the GitHub Pages site.

### Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

Want to use your own domain instead of `.github.io`? Here's how:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages** in this repository
2. Under **Custom domain**, enter your domain name
3. Add the required DNS records at your domain registrar:
   - For apex domains (example.com): Add `A` records pointing to GitHub's IPs
   - For subdomains (www.example.com): Add a `CNAME` record pointing to `[username].github.io`
4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
5. Enable **Enforce HTTPS** for security
